mypi3-28 is a new img from tatoana-2.img
mypi3-16 is a new img from tatoana-2.img

You first need to determine which drive you want copy.
sudo fdisk -l

Device     Boot  Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdc1         8192    532479    524288  256M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/sdc2       532480 121561087 121028608 57.7G 83 Linux


Next you want to create an img file that has the contents of a working 
rpi os system.  As you see from the fdisk command there are 2 partitions.

The command below will create an tatoana-2.img file from the contents of the /dev/sdc.
 
sudo dd bs=16M if=/dev/sdc status='progress' of=tatoana-2.img

sudo fdisk -l
Device     Boot Start       End   Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdc1       32768 125042687 125009920 59.6G  7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT

sudo fdisk /dev/sdc

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.33.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

The kernel still uses the old partitions. The new table will be used at the next reboot. 
Syncing disks.

Use the tool upper right hand corner to unmout the micro sd.

Note: This step can mess up your system.
